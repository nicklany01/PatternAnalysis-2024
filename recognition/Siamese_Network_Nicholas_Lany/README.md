# Siamese Network Classifier for ISIC 2020 Dataset

This project implements a **Siamese neural network** to classify skin lesion images from the **ISIC 2020 Kaggle Challenge dataset**, aiming to differentiate between normal skin and melanoma.

## Overview

Melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer, and early detection is critical for effective treatment. In this project, we create a **Siamese network-based classifier** to distinguish between images of normal skin and melanoma using the ISIC 2020 dataset. The goal of this model is to achieve an accuracy of around **0.8** on the test set.
